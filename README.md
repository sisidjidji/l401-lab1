## The Problem Domain
Within a new .NET Core console application, follow the instructions below to create a math game that takes user input, manipulates data, and utilizes error handling, by following the given the specifications.

##Program Specifications
Your solution should include the following:
Main Method
StartSequence Method
Populate Method
GetSum Method
GetProduct Method
GetQuotient
Guidance
Within the Program.cs file, add the following methods described below.

Allow the main method to output all generic exceptions. Only define specific exceptions once and pay attention to the callstack on how requests are being made.

Do not use any “global” variables in this application

Main Method
This method is given to you. Do not change the method signature.

The “Main” method should be:
static or instance: static
return type: void
parameters: string[] args
The logic within this method should:
Call the StartSequence() method from Main

Expected Exceptions:
Generic Exception
Let the user (nicely) know that they did something wrong.
Output the message of the exception to the console.
Include a finally that tells us that the program is completed.
StartSequence Method
The “StartSequence” method should be
static
void return type
no parameters
The logic within the method should
prompt the user to “Enter a number greater than zero”.
Utilize the Convert.ToInt32() method to convert the user’s input to an integer.
Instantiate a new integer array that is the size the user just inputted.
Call the Populate method.
arguments: integer array
Capture the sum by calling the GetSum method.
arguments: integer array
Capture the product by calling the GetProduct method.
integer array and integer sum
Capture the quotient by calling the GetQuotient method.
arguments: integer product
To complete the method, output to the console the details of all these values. Make sure that your output contains the same information presented in the example below. Pay attention to line breaks!
LabExample

Exceptions expected:
Format Exception
Output the message to the console
Overflow Exception
output the message to the console
Populate Method
The “Populate” method should be
static
return type: integer array
1 parameter of an integer array
The logic within the method should:
Iterate through the array and prompt the user to enter a specific number. Example: “Please enter a number 1/6” (indicate to the user what number they are inputting)
Utilize the Convert.ToInt32 method to convert the user’s input to an integer (Remember not to directly manipulate the user’s input. Store the response into a string first).
Add the number just inputted into the array.
Repeat this process until all numbers have been requested and the array is filled.
Return the populated array
Expected Exceptions:
No expected exceptions. Not even a generic exception. StartSequence will already capture your FormatException error.
GetSum Method
The method signature of GetSum should contain:
static or instance: static
return type: integer
parameters: integer array
the logic within the method should:
Declare an integer variable named sum
Iterate through the array and populate the sum variable with the sum of all the numbers together.
Add the capability to throw a custom exception if the sum is less than 20, with the message “Value of {sum} is too low”. (replace {sum} with the actual sum of the variable).
return the sum.
Expected Exceptions:
No Try/Catch required since no expected exceptions will be caught. We will have our custom exception be caught in lower levels of the callstack.
GetProduct Method
The method signature of GetProduct should contain:
static or instance: static
return type: integer
parameters: integer array, integer sum
The logic within the method should:
Ask the user the select a random number between 1 and the length of the integer array.
Declare a new variable named product
Multiply sum by the random number index that the user selected from the array (example: array[randomNumber]). Set this value to the product variable.
Return the product variable.
Expected Exceptions:
IndexOutOfRange
Output the message to the console.
throw it back down the callstack so that it displays within Main
GetQuotient Method
The method signature of GetQuotient should contain:
static or instance: static
return type: decimal
parameters: integer product
The logic within the method should:
Prompt the user to enter a number to divide the product by. Display the current product to the user during this prompt.
Retrieve the input and divide the inputted number by the product.
Utilize the decimal.Divide() method to divide the product by the dividend to receive the quotient.
Return the quotient
Expected Exceptions:
Divide by Zero Exception
Output the message to the console
Do not throw it back to Main
Return 0 if the catch gets called
Stretch Goals
Refactor your code and explore different ways to convert user input to integers. (Keep at least 1 Convert.ToInt32, but try and change the rest)
Add an additional custom exception into your code base
